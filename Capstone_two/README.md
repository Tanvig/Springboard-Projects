This project folder comprises the LeNet and AlexNet architecture implementation on MNIST-10 dataset and Cat-Dog classification dataset.

The datasets are not uploaded here due to their huge size, but can be easily downloaded.

## DATASETS

The MNIST-10 dataset can be loaded from keras library (from keras.datasets import mnist) and/or further can be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The Dog-Cat dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
