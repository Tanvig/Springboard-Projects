    "Here we have calculated the actual standard deviation of a small (size 5) data set. But in this case, this small data set is actually a sample from our larger (infinite) population. In this case, the population is infinite because we could keep drawing our normal random variates until our computers die. In general, the sample mean we calculate will not be equal to the population mean (as we saw above). A consequence of this is that the sum of squares of the deviations from the _population_ mean will be bigger than the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean. In other words, the sum of squares of the deviations from the _sample_ mean is too small to give an unbiased estimate of the _population_ variance. An example of this effect is given [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction#Source_of_bias). Scaling our estimate of the variance by the factor $n/(n-1)$ gives an unbiased estimator of the population variance. This factor is known as [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction). The consequence of this is that the $n$ in the denominator is replaced by $n-1$.\n",

You've calculated the average (the mean) of this sample and seen that this is not exactly equal to the expected population parameter (which we know because we're generating the random variates from a specific, known distribution). You've been introduced to two ways of calculating the standard deviation; one uses $n$ in the denominator and the other uses $n-1$ (Bessel's correction). You've also seen which of these calculations np.std() performs by default and how to get it to generate the other."

    "So far we've been dealing with the concept of taking a sample from a population to infer the population parameters. One statistic we calculated for a sample was the mean. As our samples will be expected to vary from one draw to another, so will our sample statistics. If we were to perform repeat draws of size $n$ and calculate the mean of each, we would expect to obtain a distribution of values. This is the sampling distribution of the mean. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that such a distribution will approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases. For the sampling distribution of the mean, the standard deviation of this distribution is given by\n",

    "This is important because typically we are dealing with samples from populations and all we know about the population is what we see in the sample. From this sample, we want to make inferences about the population. We may do this, for example, by looking at the histogram of the values and by calculating the mean and standard deviation (as estimates of the population parameters), and so we are intrinsically interested in how these quantities vary across samples. In other words, now that we've taken one sample of size $n$ and made some claims about the general population, what if we were to take another sample of size $n$? Would we get the same result? Would we make the same claims about the general population? This brings us to a fundamental question: _when we make some inference about a population based on our sample, how confident can we be that we've got it 'right'?_"

Let us imagine we live in a town of 50000 people and we know the height of everyone in this town. We will have 50000 numbers that tell us everything about our population. We'll simulate these numbers now and put ourselves in one particular town, called 'town 47', where the population mean height is 172 cm and population standard deviation is 5 cm."

Would you expect your distribution of sample means to be wider (more variable) or narrower (more consistent)? Compare your resultant summary statistics to those predicted by the CLT."

This is the key driver for us 'requiring' a certain sample size, for example you may frequently see a minimum sample size of 30 stated in many places.
